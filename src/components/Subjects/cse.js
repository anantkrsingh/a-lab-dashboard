        Laboratory courses on hands-on experiments are integral parts of
        engineering education. The content of this website aims to provide a
        virtual laboratory platform for undergraduate Engineering students
        studying the course of Digital Electronic Circuits. Using this virtual
        laboratory platform, the students will be able to perform various
        experiments to supplement their theoretical understanding of digital
        electronics. The main objective of the proposed virtual lab is to
        introduce students about the latest Computational Intelligence Tools (
        also known as soft computing tools). The training of these tools will be
        useful to develop rigorous applications in the engineering domain.
